This project aims to make it easier for you to browse Azure blob storage without having to write a program on your Mac, Linux, or Windows box.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n- Create Containers\r\n- Search Containers\r\n- Upload to Containers\r\n- Bulk download of blobs\r\n- Preview media blobs such as images, audio and video \r\n\r\n# Releases\r\n\r\n## OSX\r\n- [Live Build (64-bit)](https://azurestoragexplat.blob.core.windows.net/builds/live/osx64/build.zip)\r\n- [Beta (64-bit)](https://github.com/azure-storage/xplat/raw/gh-pages/public/releases/beta/osx/azure-storage-explorer.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n## Linux\r\n- [Live Build (64-bit)](https://azurestoragexplat.blob.core.windows.net/builds/live/linux64/build.zip)\r\n- [Beta (64-bit)](https://github.com/azure-storage/xplat/raw/gh-pages/public/releases/beta/linux/azure-storage-explorer-linux64.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n- [Live Build (64-bit)](https://azurestoragexplat.blob.core.windows.net/builds/live/win32/build.zip)\r\n- [Beta (32-bit)](https://github.com/azure-storage/xplat/raw/gh-pages/public/releases/beta/windows/azure-storage-explorer-win32.tar.gz)","google":"UA-63840058-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
